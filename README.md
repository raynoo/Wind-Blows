Geospatial and Microblogging - Visualization of an Epidemic Spread
==========

A tool that visualizes the spread of a possible epidemic disease in a city by using the citizens' tweets. The tool visualizes tweets containing clues about disease symptoms and other events on a map, and helps analyze possible causes for what is believed to be an outbreak. This application has been optimized for a 8160x2304 px (52 inch) touch-screen at UIC's EVL Lab. A scaled down version is available to be run on smaller screens as well.

Developed using: Java, Processing, Unfolding Maps, SQLite, Omicron API
